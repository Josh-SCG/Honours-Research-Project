This chapter describes the artefact that was developed in a group effort as well as the process followed for the writing of the academic article.

\section{Description of Artefact}
This research project was split into two main aspects: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item An individual research study into a chosen topic \textit{(this being the qualities needed for a computer game to be used in education)}
\item A group effort to develop a digital computer game.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent For the first aspect of this project, the resulting outcome was an academic article titled, \textit{"Linking Gamification, Ludology and Pedagogy: How to Use Serious Games for Various Knowledge Domains"}. As stipulated in the title, the fields of gamification, ludology and pedagogy were the focus of this research aspect of the project. In this article, the question posed by this project is again reiterated and sequentially answered. The article is attached to this document under Appendix  \ref{AppendixC}. 
\\\\
The artefact accompanying this research project is a digital computer came which was developed as part of a group effort as mentioned previously. While this artefact is separate from the individual research studies conducted by its' group members, it may have been influenced by the topics being researched. The artefact is titled \textit{"Puzzle Ball: Spherical Shadows"} and is further categorised as a 3D puzzle platformer with aspects of action gameplay played in first person. A playable version of the artefact is available on the website itch.io website\footnote{\url{https://josh-scg.itch.io/puzzle-ball-spherical-shadows}} and the source code of the artefact is available on GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/GCWehmeyer/Spherical_Shadows}}$^{,}$\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Josh-SCG/Spherical_Shadows}}
