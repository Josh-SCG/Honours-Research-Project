# Honours-Research-Project
This repository contains the documentation and files relating to the honours research project done by myself in 2021 in order to obtain my BSc. Hons. in Computer Science and Information Technology. 

The project is based in the field of "Entertainment Computing"

# The instructions for this project were as follows:
1. A  research project related  to computer games  will  be  done (Individually )
2. A  computer  game  must  be developed (As a group; with the only stipulation being to avoid it being a "BFG" game)

The research project was done individually on a topic of our own choice that was approved by our supervisor, while the development of the computer game was done as a group. 

This repository only contains the documentation and files relating to the project as a whole and the research project. The repositiory for the computer game source code can be found at [this repository](https://github.com/GCWehmeyer/Spherical_Shadows) and the finished computer game can be found and downloaded from [here](https://josh-scg.itch.io/puzzle-ball-spherical-shadows).
